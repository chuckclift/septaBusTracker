# septaBusTracker
Utilize the SEPTA API to keep track of the busses you need to know about

  A simple program for bus tracking.  It utilizes the SEPTA API to retreive information about the busses and their routes.

This code is almost completely based off of the septapy package, so go check it out at https://github.com/conorsch/septapy if you like the idea.  I didn't use the library because there were python3 compatibility issues.
